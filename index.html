                <h2>How Brainstorm Works</h2>
                
                <div class="modal-section">
                    <h3>Core Principles</h3>
                    <p><strong>Innovation Focus:</strong> Brainstorm must always retain capacity to drive new projects and priorities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Long-Term Ownership:</strong> Mature products transition to non-Brainstorm teams for sustained ownership.</p>
                    <p>Brainstorm will likely retain AI capability ownership in the short-to-medium term, with potential to shift ownership to where it makes sense long-term.</p>
                    <p><em>E.g. document parsing/OCR with the VCR team</em></p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="modal-section">
                    <h3>Guardrails for Balance</h3>
                    <p>Platform investment is intentional and measured; architect feedback (e.g., Adam and Phil) serves as the barometer.</p>
                    <p>Maintain at minimum a 20-person dedicated AI innovation investment, regardless of production/platform demands — a growing portfolio of systems we have built cannot slow us down.</p>
                    <p>Brainstorm Innovation squads operate with speed, minimal overhead, and limited bureaucracy.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="modal-section">
                    <h3>Organizational Model</h3>
                    <p><h4>Fluid Team Structure</h4></p>
                    <p>30 permanent engineers organized into ephemeral, project-focused Squads.</p>
                    <p>Squads spin up/down quickly, shifting capacity as priorities evolve.</p>
                    <p>Majority of squads focus on greenfield and net-new innovation.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="modal-section">
                    <h4>Innovation Squads</h4>
                    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Take ideas and move them from demo → prototype → proof of concept → pilot → wide release as quickly as possible.</p>
                    <p><strong>Operating Principles:</strong></p>
                    <p>Deliver production-ready value.</p>
                    <p>Maintain security and compliance as non-negotiables.</p>
                    <p>Operate with flexibility compared to traditional Software Engineering standards, without compromising safety.</p>
                    <p>Team members shift fluidly; the priority is placing the right person in the right role rather than reporting lines.</p>
                    <p>Prioritization driven by Product Strategy.</p>

                    <h4>ESO (Endurance, Stability & Offloading) Squad</h4>
                    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Absorb ongoing architectural, platform, and engineering needs without derailing innovation squads.</p>
                    <p>Flexes up/down with demand.</p>
                    <p>Backlog Prioritization requires alignment between Adam Lewis, Zoe, Ahmad, Kasey, and SEMs/POs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Focus Areas:</strong></p>
                    <p>Platformize products. Address architectural improvements. Deliver quality-of-life & engineering enhancements. Support data platform needs. Expand QA & test automation. Repackage, handoff, & transfer ownership. Drive continuous improvement, monitoring, support, & maintenance.</p>

                    <h4>Data Engineering</h4>
                    <p>Brainstorm includes 3 permanent Data Engineers to support organizational data needs.</p>
                    <p>Embed with Innovation Squads for data-intensive projects.</p>
                    <p>Shift to ESO backlog when demand is low, tackling items generated by Architecture, PS, or Engineering.</p>
